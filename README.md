NyayaConnect is a revolutionary mobile application designed to make India’s new criminal laws accessible and comprehensible to all. With the introduction of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)**, and **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)**, this app bridges the gap between complex legal texts and public understanding.
