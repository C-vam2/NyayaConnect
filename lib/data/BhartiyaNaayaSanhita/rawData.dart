Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it”.\n(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part of this Sanhita in conformity with the explanation.\n(3) When property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that person, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.\nExplanation.—A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section.\n(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.\n(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.\n(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.\n(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.\nIllustration.\nA intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z. A has committed murder.\n(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence.\nIllustrations..\n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.\n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.\n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.\nIllustration.\nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide."

Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence.\nIllustration.\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.\nIllustration.\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder."

A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nIllustration.\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\nIllustration.\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder."

Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order\nto such taking, he has committed theft.\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if\nA’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A\nhas committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain\ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins\nto move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs\naway with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall\nreturn. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession.\nIt could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though\nhe may have committed criminal breach of trust.\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring\nis in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by\ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to\nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a\nplace where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking\nthe ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of\nfirst moving the ring, commits theft.\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not\nowing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a\nsecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away.\nHere A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed\ntheft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as\na security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of\ndepriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes\nit dishonestly.\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without\nZ’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the\nwatch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with\nthe intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here\nA takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes\naway a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the\nintention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s\nimplied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She givesA money, food and clothes, which A knows\nto belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that Amay conceive that Z’s wife is authorised\nto give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to\nbelong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If\nA takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes\nthat property out of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not\ncommit theft.\n(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description\nfor a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second\nor subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with\nrigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend\nto five years and with fine:\nProvided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five\nthousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value\nof property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with community service."

A, in order to defraud\nB, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by\nB that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b)A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z’s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance\nof an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining\nfrom B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any\nsum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the\nsum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed byA, without inserting the\nsum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten\nthousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the\ncheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority,\nintending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its\nmaturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to\nsuppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f) Z’s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally\ndivided between A, B and C”.A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be\nbelieved that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order\nby writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B\ndishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special\nendorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate,\nexecutes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the\nconveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he\nconveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the\nlegatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his\ninstructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j) Awrites a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is\na man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune,\nintending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made\na false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.\n(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s\ncharacter, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as\nmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter\ninto an express or implied contract for service.\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that\nthe bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in\norder that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and\nnegotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B,\nknowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of\nforgery.\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same\nname. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was\nendorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the\nseizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent\nand for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to\ndefraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B,\nthough he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and\nwith intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a\npromissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the\nnote, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of\ninsolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person,\nintending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a\ndeceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in\nhis lifetime, may amount to forgery.\nIllustration.\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in\nthe name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.

A affirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged. A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that deed is forged; but A cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that the deed is forged.\n(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away. Evidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper course. A produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course. A may prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under clause (b) of section 26.\n(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Kolkata. He produces a letter written by himself and dated at Chennai on that day, and bearing the Chennai post-mark of that day. The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead, it would be admissible under clause (b) of section 26.\n(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value. A may prove these statements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.\n(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit currency which he knew to be counterfeit. He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the currency as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that person did examine it and told him it was genuine. A may prove these facts."
